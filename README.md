Analysis of fandango movie rating system to determine if the company is appropriating the ratings

In this project we will be analysing the ratings provided by fandango to find out if the company is displaying enhanced ratings
to its users. In october 2015, A data journalist by the name of Walt Hickey found out that the ratings on the website of fandango
are slightly higher than the actual ratings(the one's found on the html of the website).Since then, fandango has come forward and claimed
that they have fixed their rating system.

We will compare the rating in 2015 to the one's in 2016 to see if there is any change in the rating system of fandango
